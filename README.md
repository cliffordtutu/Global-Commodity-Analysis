This project focuses on understanding global mining activities across countries, continents, and commodities.

Project objective:
To analyze a large mining dataset and identify:
•	Countries with the highest number of unique mining units
•	The most widely produced and intensive commodities globally
•	How mining activities vary by development status and operation type

What I worked with:
•	304,000+ rows of global mining data
•	Excel Power Pivot for data modeling and transformation
•	Normalized commodity data to avoid double counting
•	Created unique mining unit identifiers to handle duplicate site names

Key insights:
•	A small number of countries dominate global mining activity
•	Some commodities are both geographically widespread and highly intensive
•	Surface mining operations are more prevalent than underground methods

I also built an interactive Excel dashboard with KPIs, slicers, charts, and a live map to make the analysis intuitive and decision-focused.

This project strengthened my skills in data cleaning, modeling, and analytical thinking using Excel, especially with large, real-world datasets.
